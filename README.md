# FLAPPYBIRD
Flappy Bird is a simple, side-scrolling mobile game where players tap the screen to make a bird fly through gaps between pipes without hitting them. The goal is to survive as long as possible and score points by passing through each set of pipes. It became wildly popular for its addictive yet frustrating gameplay.
