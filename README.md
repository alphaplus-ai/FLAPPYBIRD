# FLAPPYBIRD
This project is a custom-built Flappy Bird clone developed in Java, replicating the core mechanics of the original viral mobile game. The game features simple yet challenging tap-to-fly mechanics, where the player controls a bird navigating through randomly spaced pipes. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score without hitting any obstacles or the ground.

The game is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and rendering. Key features include gravity-based physics, smooth bird animation, dynamic obstacle generation, accurate collision detection, real-time score tracking, and basic game state management (Start, Playing, Game Over). The code follows object-oriented programming principles to ensure clarity, modularity, and ease of future enhancement.

This project was a personal learning experience aimed at understanding game development fundamentals, GUI design in Java, and event-driven programming. It can be extended with additional features like sound effects, difficulty scaling, or a leaderboard system. Feel free to clone, fork, or contribute!
